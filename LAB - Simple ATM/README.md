# Simple ATM - Instructions

This course has mentioned over and over the importance of having a plan (defining diagram, solution algorithm, and desk checking) before starting to write any code in a programming language, such as Java, as part of the problem solving process. With an accurate plan, coding in a programming language usually becomes mostly trivial and makes problem solving much more manageable.

Review the defining diagram and solution algorithm below:

| **Input** | **Processing** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accountBalance <br>Set of accountTransactions: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - transactionAction <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -  transactionAmount | - Prompt for accountBalance <br> - Read accountBalance <br> - Validate accountBalance <br> - Prompt for accountTransaction <br> - Read accountTransaction <br> - Validate accountTransaction <br> - Calculate newAccountBalance <br> - Display newAccountBalance <br> - Accumulate transaction action counts <br> - Display transaction action counts | - accountBalance  <br> - finalAccountBalance <br> - numDeposits <br> - numWithdrawals |

Write a Java program that implements the diagram identified. Your Java code should carefully follow what has been listed in the diagram.

**Note:**  For input/output, you must use the JOptionPane class.
